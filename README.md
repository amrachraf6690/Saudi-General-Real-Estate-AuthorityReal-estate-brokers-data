That script is in the collaboration with Mohammed Ahmed Gamea (  [**https://linkedin.com/in/mohamed-gamea/**](https://linkedin.com/in/mohamed-gamea/) )

This project is to get the data of the saudi arabia brokers.
The project goal is to parse data of Jeddah brokers

# Get The Count Of Rows
The First step to start working with the project is to run "Get Count.py" File to get the count of brokers (We will need it later)

# Run the main script
Then we ran "Script.py" to start parsing the data.
We will use the rows count we got from "Get Count.py" to set the limit of for loop at the line number 5 at "Script.py".
we do that step (for loop at line 5) divided by 10 because the api return info of 10 each time...
